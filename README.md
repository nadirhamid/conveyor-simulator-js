Why
===========================================================

To simulate a conveyer's continuous weight load, between elapses of time -- 
this could be minutes, hours or even months. 


What it does
===========================================================

"Conveyer Machine Simulator" Simulates continuous weight on a conveyer belt. Simulators
will generate psuedo random numbers within a range. This range
will then be used through the programs runtime. 


It's Features
===========================================================

Very simple program has one feature, it is reset this
